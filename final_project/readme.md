## Handheld Arduino Game
A handheld game prototype developed as my final project for CMU's 18-095: Getting Started in Electronics.

## Oveview
As an exploration into non-traditional input systems, this Arduino project uses a slide potentiometer to control the player's vertical position. The game itself is inspired by Flappy Bird.

## Hardware
- Arduino Mega
- 3.5'' LCD Screen
- Slide Potentiometer
- Buttons

## Setup
- I downloaded the TFT_HX8357 library from [github.com/Bodmer/TFT_HX8357]
